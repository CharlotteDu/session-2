    <h1> Accross the Universe - the Beatles </h1>
    <h3> Le groupe </h3>
     <p> <strong> The Beatles </strong> The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as "Beatlemania", and as the group's music grew in sophistication in subsequent years, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. </p>
   <h2> Les paroles </h2>
      <p> Words are flowing out like </br>
      Endless rain into a paper cup </br>
      They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe </br> 
      Pools of sorrow waves of joy </br>
      Are drifting through my opened mind </br>
      Possessing and caressing me </br> </p>

      <p> Jai guru deva om </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br> </p>

      <p> Images of broken light which </br>
      dance before me like a million eyes, </br>
      They call me on and on across the universe Thoughts meander like a </br>
      restless wind  Inside a letter box </br>
      They stumble blindly as they make their way across the universe </br> </p>

      <p> Jai guru deva om </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br> </p>


      <p> Sounds of laughter shades of life </br>
      are ringing Through my open ears </br>
      inciting and inviting me </br>
      Limitless undying love which </br>
      shines around me like a million suns </br>
      And calls me on and on across the universe </br> </p>


      <p> Jai guru deva om </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br>
      Nothing's gonna change my world </br> </p>

      <p> Jai guru deva </br>
      Jai guru deva </br>
      Jai guru deva </br> 
      Jai guru deva </br> </p>
